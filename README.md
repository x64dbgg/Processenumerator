## ProcMonitor - Process Enumerator
# Description

ProcMonitor is an advanced Windows kernel-mode driver that shows techniques for intercepting and monitoring process enumeration. This project provides insights into hooking mechanisms, managing process lists, and interacting between user-mode and kernel-mode applications in Windows.
Features

    Intercepts Process Enumeration: Monitors and optionally filters process enumeration calls.
    User-Mode Interface: Includes a user-mode application for sending commands to the kernel-mode driver.
    Advanced Hooking Techniques: Demonstrates secure and efficient hooking in the Windows kernel.
    Educational Tool: Ideal for learning kernel-mode programming, process management, and hooking strategies.
